    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>7/4 pounds whole-wheat macaroni</li>
        <li>3/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>6 cups milk, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mustard powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>ground black pepper</li>
        <li>8 ounce shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>24 ounce shredded American cheese</li>
        <li>8 ounce bag of potato chips, crushed</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1/3 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>butter-flavored cookiing spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Boil a large pot of lightly salted water. Cook macaroni in boiling water, stirring occasionally for about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large pot over medium-low heat, slowly add flour and whisk constantly. Cook until brown and the 
            mixture no longer smells of flour, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour 1 cup milk into the flour mixture, whisking continually until fully incorporated, about 45 seconds; repeat twice.</li>
        <li>Add remaining 3 cups milk to the mixture, whisking to incorporate.</li>
        <li>Stir Worcestershire sauce, mustard powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper into the mixture; season with salt and 
            black pepper.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low and continue to cook sauce, whisking frequently until it begins to thicken, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add about 4 ounces of shredded cheddar cheese; stir continually until the cheese melts completely. Repeat with 
            remaining cheddar cheese and American cheese, about 4 ounces at a time. Once cheese is entirely incorporated, 
            remove sauce from heat.</li>
        <li>Stir drained macaroni into the cheese sauce to coat.</li>
        <li>Divide macaroni between two 9x13-inch baking dishes.</li>
        <li>Mix crushed potato chips, 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese, and parmesan cheese in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Top the macaroni with the potato chip mixture evenly.</li>
        <li>Spray the potato chip mixture with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and the sauce is bubbling, about 35 to 45 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
